# Songs from the Shuttered

**Songs from the Shuttered** is a conceptual photographic project that transforms songs into still images. Each photograph interprets the narrative, emotion, and symbolism of a song, creating a visual translation of music.

This repository contains the **official website** for the project, featuring a gallery of images, audio playback, behind-the-scenes videos, and a PDF book.
